# LCU Initiative

Documentation and automation code for the Library Capacity Unit (LCU) project.

The release repository for this project is maintained at GitHub:

    https://github.com/ualibraries/tess-ops-lcu
    
There is a corresponding GitBook repository used for documentation publishing:

    https://gitbook.com/book/ualibraries/tess-ops-lcu
    
Note that all commits should go against the GitHub repository; the GitBook toolchain
is configured to watch for master-branch commits and automatically update and publish
the documentation.
