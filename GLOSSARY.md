## Library Capacity Unit
Also, "LCU". The minimum deployment of self-contained, redundant capacity as designed;
the "lego brick" that can be duplicated to add expansion capacity.  The design of the LCU
includes enclosures, power and cooling, environmental monitoring, networking, computing,
and storage capacity.  It is one example of "pod-based" data center architecture
design developed at the UA Libraries.
