## Outstanding Issues

*   The email settings on PDU-1B-A and PDU-1B-B look a little strange; when
    you try to display them, you get this error text:
    
        The Model indicated that the query failed to process.
        
    inserted into the output.  I saw similar behavior on PDU-1A-A, deleted
    the email contact info, re-entered it, and re-tested the contract, and
    it cleared up.  Doing the same on the PDU-1B-A/B PDUs didn't fix the
    problem.  It also looks like PDU-1B-B isn't sending email correctly.
