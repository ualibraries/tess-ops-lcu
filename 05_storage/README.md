# Storage Capacity

In the LCU, storage capacity (beyond what is supplied by the compute nodes) is
supplied by [Qumulo scale-out NAS appliances][qumulo]; initial configuration was for
six appliances (the minimum cluster size that supports 10/8 [erasure coding][ec]),
with a planned expansion over the next several years to twelve nodes in the
cluster.
